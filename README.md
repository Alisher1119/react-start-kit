Custom UI library built with React, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS v4, and TypeScript.

## Features

- 🚀 **Modern Stack**: Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4.
- 🎨 **Beautifully Styled**: Includes a comprehensive set of UI components.
- ♿ **Accessible**: Built on top of Radix UI primitives for accessibility.
- 🛠️ **Customizable**: Easy to extend and customize.
- 📦 **Tree-shakeable**: Import only what you need.

## Installation

```bash
npm install react-start-kit
```

## Setup

To use the styles, import the CSS file in your root entry file (e.g., `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, or `index.js`).

```tsx
import 'react-start-kit/dist/react-start-kit.css';
```

## Usage

Import components directly from the package:

```tsx
import { Button } from 'react-start-kit';

function App() {
  return (
    <Button variant="default" onClick={() => console.log('Clicked!')}>
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

You can also import specific components to optimize bundle size:

```tsx
import { Alert, AlertTitle, AlertDescription } from 'react-start-kit/alert';

<Alert>
  <AlertTitle>Heads up!</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    This is a description inside an alert component.
  </AlertDescription>
</Alert>;
```

- **Accordion**: Vertically stacked set of interactive headings.
